> A comprehensive REST API testing framework demonstrating modern test automation practices with Playwright. Features include data-driven testing, CI/CD integration, and intentional failure testing to showcase real-world API limitations.


## Features

- ✅ 27 automated API test cases
- ✅ Tests for GET, POST, PUT, DELETE operations
- ✅ Data-driven testing approach
- ✅ Response validation (status codes, headers, body)
- ✅ CI/CD integration with GitHub Actions
- ✅ HTML test reports

## Tech Stack

- **Playwright** - API testing framework
- **TypeScript** - Programming language
- **Node.js** - Runtime environment
- **GitHub Actions** - CI/CD pipeline

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm or yarn

## 📋 Test Case Documentation

Detailed test cases with pre-conditions, steps, and expected results are documented in:
- Test Case sheet is in docs folder
- [Test Case Specification](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UBj2W_RnPmmCuRkp93y7dPKnmcBqlrmedOg1rReInYc/edit?usp=sharing)


### Key Test Scenarios:
- ✅ CRUD operations validation
- ✅ Response time verification (< 2000ms)
- ✅ Special character handling
- ✅ Invalid input validation
- ✅ Data-driven testing with multiple datasets

## API Under Test

**JSONPlaceholder**: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/

A free fake REST API for testing and prototyping.

## ⚠️ Known Issues / API Limitations

JSONPlaceholder is a mock API with some limitations:

1. **TC010 - Missing Title Validation**: API accepts posts without required fields
   - Expected: 400 Bad Request
   - Actual: 201 Created
   
2. **TC014 - Non-existent Resource Update**: Returns 500 instead of 404
   - Expected: 404 Not Found
   - Actual: 500 Internal Server Error

3. **TC015 - Update with invalid data**: Returns 200 instead of 400
   - Expected: 400 Bad Request
   - Actual: 200 OK

4. **TC017 - Delete Non-existent Post**: Returns 200 for non-existent resources
   - Expected: 404 Not Found
   - Actual: 200 OK

5. **TC018 - Verify response body after deletion**: Returns {} 200 OK for deleted resource
   - Expected: 404 Not Found
   - Actual: 200 OK

6. **TC021 - Handle invalid userid**: Returns 200
   - Expected: 404 Invalid Type
   - Actual: 200 OK

These tests are marked with `test.fail()` to document expected behavior vs actual API responses.

## CI/CD

Tests run automatically on:
- Every push to main branch
- Every pull request
- Daily schedule (midnight UTC)
